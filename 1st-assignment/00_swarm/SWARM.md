# 🐝 Swarm - Experimental Multi-Agent Framework by OpenAI

Swarm is an experimental framework developed by OpenAI that explores how multiple AI agents can collaborate efficiently. It focuses on simplicity and modularity, making it easier for developers to orchestrate agent-based systems without overwhelming complexity.

## 🔍 What is Swarm?

Swarm introduces two core ideas:

### 🔹 Agents
Agents are independent entities, each designed to handle a specific type of task. They operate autonomously and can use tools, process instructions, or respond to input based on their individual logic.

### 🔹 Handoffs
Handoffs allow agents to pass tasks to one another. This makes the system dynamic, letting the most appropriate agent handle each part of the task.

For example, a general-purpose agent might detect a billing query and hand it off to a specialized billing agent for a more accurate response.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

- Encourages **modular architecture** in AI systems.
- Enables **task delegation** across specialized agents.
- Makes systems more **scalable** and **testable**.

Swarm was an early prototype that inspired the more mature **Agents SDK**, which is now available for production use.

## 🛠 How to Explore Swarm

Although Swarm itself is not officially released as a public SDK, developers can:

1. Learn the **core principles** by studying handoffs and agent-based delegation.
2. Experiment with multi-agent orchestration using the **OpenAI Agents SDK**.
3. Apply patterns like **routing**, **prompt chaining**, and **parallelization** (used by Anthropic and others).

## 🔄 Evolution into Agents SDK

Swarm acted as the foundation for OpenAI's Agents SDK. The SDK builds upon Swarm’s lightweight ideas but is more robust, offering:

- Tool and function calling
- Agent workflows
- Guardrails and evaluation

## 🧩 Related Design Patterns

Swarm and the Agents SDK reflect several well-known AI agent design strategies, including:

- **Prompt Chaining**: Break down tasks into smaller parts.
- **Routing**: Send input to the most relevant agent.
- **Parallel Execution**: Let agents handle tasks simultaneously.
- **Orchestrator-Worker Model**: One agent manages others.
- **Evaluator-Optimizer**: Feedback-driven improvement.

## 📘 Summary

Swarm introduced a modular way to build intelligent systems with multiple agents collaborating. It laid the groundwork for OpenAI's modern agent orchestration tools and is a useful concept for developers building AI systems that need to be both intelligent and organized.
